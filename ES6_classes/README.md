<h1 align="center">ES6 classes</h1>

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new way of creating objects and dealing with inheritance in JavaScript through the use of classes.

## Class Declaration:
Classes are declared using the class keyword. They can contain a constructor method for initializing objects, along with other methods.

                                class Animal {
                                constructor(name) {
                                    this.name = name;
                                }

                                greet() {
                                    return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
                                }
                                }
                        
## Class Inheritance:
Classes can inherit from other classes using the extends keyword. This allows for creating a hierarchy of classes.

                                class Dog extends Animal {
                                constructor(name, breed) {
                                    super(name);
                                    this.breed = breed;
                                }

                                bark() {
                                    return 'Woof!';
                                }
                                }


## Creating Instances:
Instances of classes are created using the new keyword.

                                const myDog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
                                console.log(myDog.greet()); // Output: Hello, I'm Buddy
                                console.log(myDog.bark()); // Output: Woof!


## Class Methods and Properties:
Classes can contain various methods and properties that define their behavior and characteristics.

                                const anotherDog = new Dog('Max', 'Poodle');
                                console.log(anotherDog.name); // Output: Max
                                console.log(anotherDog.greet()); // Output: Hello, I'm Max
                                console.log(anotherDog.bark()); // Output: Woof!

## Benefits of ES6 Classes:
Provides a cleaner syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance.
Encourages the use of object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.
