<h1 align="center">Node.js Basics</h1>

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the web browser, empowering developers to build scalable, efficient, and server-side applications.

## Key Features:

### JavaScript Runtime: 
Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side, facilitating the development of full-stack applications.
### Event-Driven Architecture: 
It operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, optimizing throughput and scalability for applications handling a high volume of requests.
### Vast Ecosystem: 
It boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available through Node Package Manager (NPM), allowing developers to easily integrate modules, packages, and tools into their projects.
### Asynchronous Programming: 
Node.js excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it ideal for applications with concurrent connections, such as real-time web applications, APIs, and microservices.
### Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
It supports various operating systems, making it versatile for developing applications that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started:

To start using Node.js, you'll need to:

### Install Node.js: 
Download and install Node.js from the official website. It comes bundled with npm, which is Node's package manager.
Create a Project: Set up a new directory for your project and initialize it by running npm init to create a package.json file.
### Write Code: 
Begin writing your JavaScript code using Node.js. You can create server applications, APIs, command-line tools, and more.

### Using Nodemon for Development:
Nodemon is a tool that helps in automatic restarting of Node.js applications during development. Install Nodemon globally:
                                                    npm install -g nodemon

Then run your Node.js application using Nodemon:
                                                    nodemon app.js
